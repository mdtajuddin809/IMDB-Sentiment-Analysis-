# IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis-
IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using Deep Learning (Simple RNN) and Streamlit. This project predicts whether a movie review is Positive or Negative using a trained RNN model on the IMDB dataset, with real-time prediction through an interactive web app.
How It Works

User enters a movie review

Text is preprocessed:

Lowercasing

Removing punctuation

Tokenization

Padding

Review is passed to the trained RNN model

Model predicts sentiment

Result is displayed on the web app

📊 Example Output

Input:
"The movie was amazing and the acting was fantastic"

Output:
✅ Positive
Prediction Score: 0.92

🚀 Features
